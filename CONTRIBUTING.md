## Guidelines for Adding Resources

### Quality Standards

- **Relevance**: The resource must be directly related to structured thinking, ontologies, constraint-based systems, or closely related topics like knowledge graphs, semantic web, logic programming, or formal methods.

- **Quality**: The resource should be well-maintained, documented, and widely used or academically recognized.

- **Active**: Prefer resources that are actively maintained. If adding an archived or historical resource, please note its status.

- **Free or Open Access**: Prioritize freely accessible resources. Commercial tools should provide significant value and have a free tier or trial.

### Format

Use the following format when adding resources:

```markdown
- [Resource Name](URL) - Brief description explaining what it is and why it's useful.
```

**Example:**
```markdown
- [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) - Free, open-source ontology editor and framework for building intelligent systems.
```

### Description Guidelines

- Keep descriptions concise (1-2 sentences).
- Start with what the resource *is*, then optionally mention key features or use cases.
- Use proper grammar and punctuation.
- Avoid marketing language or superlatives unless objectively verifiable.
- End with a period.

### Categorization

Place your resource in the most appropriate section:

- **Ontologies and Knowledge Representation**: For ontologies, vocabularies, and ontology development tools.
- **Constraint-Based Systems**: For constraint satisfaction solvers and constraint programming tools.
- **Structured Thinking Tools**: For mind mapping, concept mapping, and argument mapping tools.
- **Knowledge Graphs**: For knowledge graph platforms, construction tools, and public knowledge graphs.
- **Semantic Web Technologies**: For RDF, SPARQL, OWL, and linked data tools.
- **Logic Programming and Reasoning**: For theorem provers, logic solvers, and reasoners.
- **Planning and Scheduling**: For automated planning systems and scheduling tools.
- **Datasets and Benchmarks**: For benchmark datasets and evaluation resources.
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: For programming libraries organized by language.
- **Research Papers and Books**: For academic resources and literature.
- **Learning Resources**: For tutorials, courses, and educational materials.

If your resource doesn't fit existing categories, suggest a new category in your pull request.

### Alphabetical Order

Within each section or subsection, resources should be listed in alphabetical order (case-insensitive).

## What NOT to Submit

- **Off-topic resources**: Resources that don't relate to structured thinking, ontologies, constraints, or closely related domains.
- **Low-quality or unmaintained projects**: Projects that are abandoned, poorly documented, or have significant issues.
- **Duplicates**: Resources already listed in the document.
- **Self-promotion without merit**: While you can suggest your own projects, they must meet the same quality standards as other resources.
- **Paywalled content without free alternatives**: Commercial resources must provide free access to basic features or documentation.

## Updating Existing Resources

If you find that:
- A link is broken or outdated
- A description is inaccurate
- A resource has been deprecated or archived

Please submit a pull request to update or remove the resource, with an explanation in the PR description.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive in all interactions. We're building this list together for the benefit of the community.

## Questions?

If you're unsure about whether a resource belongs in this list, or have questions about the contribution process, feel free to open an issue to discuss before submitting a pull request.
